                When I'm not struggling to keep my yard alive in the Carolina heat, I like to spend my free time exercising, reading books,
                 or playing video games. I have recently taken up stained glass making as a hobby and am still quite horrible at it.

                 I have two cats whom I pretend can understand me. I also like to think I'm a pretty decent cook.

                 I made this site and all of the associated projects as a way to stay sharp with web-development. I'm always looking throw new
                 learn new things and enjoy the process of turning a concept from an idea into working code.
